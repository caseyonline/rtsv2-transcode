[S] - rtsv2_rtmp_ingest_handler currently has hardcoded salt / challenge - to be held in gen_server once LLNW API is finalised
[S] - ingest instance stop need to remove instance from aggregator - just need test
[S] - handle multiple ingest aggregators
[S] - client API in shared
[ ] - test4 - IngestAggregator with a name clash - 2 things running, should be 1
[ ] - test5 - Multiple trans-pops with a name clash - 2 things running, should be 1
[ ] - test6 - Multiple stream-relay with a name clash - 2 things running, should be 1
[ ] - add stream_id domain to logs that are pre-stream
[A] - Bus should have its own set of messages
[ ] - check serf errors from serf_api correctly map to whatever we've said in purs - get_coordinate in particular
[A] - Erl.Cowboy.Req.binding - returns Maybe a - it doesn't know what a is.  Should be Maybe Foreign
[A] - Clean up / rewrite gproc.purs - is it a direct mapping, or do we want our own API
[ ] - intraPoP load messages
[ ] - transPoP load messages
[ ] - have an http wrapper that does local gen_server call if on same node (ingestInstance - local / remote?)

[x] - if ingest aggregator exits, then ingest instances need to reallocate a new aggregator
[x] - move ingest-instance aggregator start logic out of init and retry failure on timer
[x] - metrics (rrt) for trans-pop neigbours
[x] - Stetson isConflict
[x] - WAN definitition / neighbours file
[x] - resurrect the WAN topology discovery code
[x] - combine rtt times with WAN topology
[x] - SpudGun.purs is inconsistent in Maybe vs Either in results
[x] - Newtypes for key variables
[x] - intra -> trans pop updates via function calls
[x] - handleInfo in Pinto to support CastResult
[x] - stops on clients
[x] - edge agent needs to tick
[x] - remove /poc from API
[x] - review gproc registration for top level supervisors and gen servers (i.e dont use it!)
[x] - config in ingestAggregatorAgent - currently timer hardcoded - move all config records to config.purs
[x] - serf api should take left and right constructors
[x] - can msgPack take arbitrary binaries
[x] - test1 - hit edge / start ingest / hit edge again
[x] - elect trans pop leader
[x] - test2 - hit edge / start ingest in different pop / hit edge again
[x] - make intrapop rejoin if not enough members
[x] - make transpop rejoin if not enough members
[x] - /alive should include healthcheck - indicate if joined to enough peers
[x] - separate intra-pop serf from trans-pop serf messages
[x] - currentTransPoP appears to be wrong sometimes...
[x] - transPoP leave - ensure serf restarts (systemd) and maybe assert on each tick that still not a member
[x] - reconnect stream if we get a stream-failed (intra and trans) - will need to call serf.members
