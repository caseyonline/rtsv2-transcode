[ ] - intrapop to raise bus message if relay exits
      - egest to subscribe and take appropriate action - either exit itself or launch new relay?
[ ] - Pinto stuff, async init, return stop from init
[ ] - multiple IngestAggregators for same slot/role
[ ] - add stream_id domain to logs that are per-stream
[ ] - transPoP load messages
[ ] - double check remote status through TransPoP
[ ] - audio only - needs change to StreamDetails to indicate no video, since aggregator is currently waiting for iframe to sync multiple streams
[ ] - Mediavault API integration
[ ] - RTMP Egest - from edge
[ ] - egest / client merging when load drops
[ ] - relay merging when multiple instances start
[ ] - Port Data.Int53 or Data.Long to purescript, and then change Milliseconds type
[ ] - Proper Serf messages codec (not just binary to term)
[ ] - possibly announcing presence of stream in ingest aggregator too quickly - webrtc tests currently need a small sleep to get reliable playback
[ ] - servers need a 16-bit id adding to them

Tests:
[ ] - data object store
[ ] - discovery API
[ ]	- multi-bitrate ingest
[ ] - ingest prometheus stats
[ ] - egest prometheus stats

[x] - Canary / startup / migrating clients away etc
[x] - data object messaging
[x] - Egest needs to know model primary and backup
[x] - HLS Egest from Aggregator
[x] - ingest to timeout and exit if not media seen for X seconds - https://jira.atlas.llnw.com/browse/RTSV2-54
[x] - intraPoP load messages
[x] - Generic onFoo messages out of RTMP ingest
[x] - Clean up / rewrite gproc.purs - is it a direct mapping, or do we want our own API (Nick has taken on general cleanup)
[x] - Shared objects
[x] - relay exit management
[x] - review timeouts in tests
[x] - onFi passthrough from RTMP
[x] - Media.Rtmp.foreignToMetadata to have try/catch everywhere so as not to die horribly if client encoder sends unexpected metadata
[x] - Lots of gen server calls are not checking return values.  Let It Crash
[x] - Pinto Either stuff
[x] - ingest / ingest aggregator monitoring and recovery
[x] - Pinto terminate
[x] - Erl.Cowboy.Req.binding - returns Maybe a - it doesn't know what a is.  Should be Maybe Foreign - superseeded by Duplex support
[x] - what does /api/state return for aggregators when both primary and backup preset - suspect it needs role in there...
[x] - When egest shuts down, stream relay crashes with udp error
[x] - check serf errors from serf_api correctly map to whatever we've said in purs - get_coordinate in particular
[x] - Ingest handler to do nicer spawn stuff ala Client
[x] - why is egestInstance doing timed announcements
[x] - rtsv2_rtmp_ingest_handler currently has hardcoded salt / challenge - to be held in gen_server once LLNW API is finalised
[x] - derive regularity of liveness checks from re-broadcast interval
[x] - TransPoP clock by streamId and server
[x] - RTMP metadata
[x] - Ephemeral asset maps - and retransmission by intrapop based on timers.  Sendafter with the message....
[x] - Ensure everyone agrees on the transPoPLeader
[x] - test methods to allow multple body checks
[x] - Relay chains for egest
[x] - Relay chains for other relays
[x] - Send liveness messages far more rarely?  Just for ingestAggregator?
[x] - Consider only having intrapop messages for start / stop and VM liveness - with a VM liveness ref so restarts are detected
[x] - Use monitors within a VM and have IntraPoP take care of sending all messages on timers
[x] - Bus should have its own set of messages
[x] - workflow metrics to prometheus
[x] - ffmpeg visual for demo
[x] - ingest instance stop need to remove instance from aggregator - just need test
[x] - if ingest aggregator exits, then ingest instances need to reallocate a new aggregator
[x] - move ingest-instance aggregator start logic out of init and retry failure on timer
[x] - metrics (rrt) for trans-pop neigbours
[x] - Stetson isConflict
[x] - WAN definitition / neighbours file
[x] - resurrect the WAN topology discovery code
[x] - combine rtt times with WAN topology
[x] - SpudGun.purs is inconsistent in Maybe vs Either in results
[x] - Newtypes for key variables
[x] - intra -> trans pop updates via function calls
[x] - handleInfo in Pinto to support CastResult
[x] - stops on clients
[x] - edge agent needs to tick
[x] - remove /poc from API
[x] - review gproc registration for top level supervisors and gen servers (i.e dont use it!)
[x] - config in ingestAggregatorAgent - currently timer hardcoded - move all config records to config.purs
[x] - serf api should take left and right constructors
[x] - can msgPack take arbitrary binaries
[x] - test1 - hit edge / start ingest / hit edge again
[x] - elect trans pop leader
[x] - test2 - hit edge / start ingest in different pop / hit edge again
[x] - make intrapop rejoin if not enough members
[x] - make transpop rejoin if not enough members
[x] - /alive should include healthcheck - indicate if joined to enough peers
[x] - separate intra-pop serf from trans-pop serf messages
[x] - currentTransPoP appears to be wrong sometimes...
[x] - transPoP leave - ensure serf restarts (systemd) and maybe assert on each tick that still not a member
[x] - reconnect stream if we get a stream-failed (intra and trans) - will need to call serf.members
