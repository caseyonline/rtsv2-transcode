[ ] - review gproc registration for top level supervisors and gen servers (i.e dont use it!)
[ ] - test4 - IngestAggregator with a name clash - 2 things running, should be 1
[ ] - test5 - Multiple trans-pops with a name clash - 2 things running, should be 1
[ ] - test6 - Multiple stream-relay with a name clash - 2 things running, should be 1
[ ] - add stream_id domain to logs that are pre-stream
[ ] - maybe loose bus between intra-pop and trans-pop
[x] - config in ingestAggregatorAgent - currently timer hardcoded - move all config records to config.purs
[x] - serf api should take left and right constructors
[x] - can msgPack take arbitrary binaries
[x] - test1 - hit edge / start ingest / hit edge again
[x] - elect trans pop leader
[x] - test2 - hit edge / start ingest in different pop / hit edge again
[x] - make intrapop rejoin if not enough members
[x] - make transpop rejoin if not enough members
[x] - /alive should include healthcheck - indicate if joined to enough peers
[x] - separate intra-pop serf from trans-pop serf messages
[x] - currentTransPoP appears to be wrong sometimes...
[x] - transPoP leave - ensure serf restarts (systemd) and maybe assert on each tick that still not a memeber
[x] - reconnect stream if we get a stream-failed (intra and trans) - will need to call serf.members
